# Prompt Exercise

The prompt used was " Write a structured systematic literature review on data mining and machine learning applications" and the AI used was ChatGPT, Claude and Copilot.

## ChatGPT

It was very structured and detailed. It had multiple sections such as methodology, challenges, insights and predictions. Key findings were very precised and easy to understand. ChatGPT also provided trends and research gaps under future directions section. There were multiple research questions (4) and they were all answered with multiple data mining and ML techniques, and different applications.

## Claude

Claude was a little more detailed and included more information on the review. It also had more sections such as recommendations for practitioners and researchers, ethical considerations, and a more expanded section on methodologies. It is very well structured and it goes in deeper detail than ChatGPT or Copilot, and yet it is still very easy to read and understand.

## Copilot

Copilot review was the shortest of all. Not a lot of detail, it was more titles than little explanations. However, the way it was structured was with many graphs. A comparative table, a timeline, and it also asked more questions before drafting.

## Final Review

The final review is a 13 page documents, rich in information and graphs. It only has 4 research questions, but they are broader questions that require more information. It also includes information that is not on any of the three original documents. I decided to use Claude as I believe this AI for papers it is amazing for reasoning and structure. Here is the final review by Claude.

### 8.2 Finance: Fraud Detection System

Zhang & Liu (2020) implemented an ensemble-based fraud detection system for a major financial institution. The system combined gradient boosting machines, neural networks, and anomaly detection algorithms to identify potentially fraudulent transactions in real-time. Deployed on a stream processing platform, the system analyzed over 10 million transactions daily with a false positive rate of only 0.3%. The implementation reduced fraud losses by approximately \$15 million annually while improving customer experience by minimizing legitimate transaction declines.

### 8.3 Manufacturing: Predictive Maintenance

Lee et al. (2022) developed a predictive maintenance system for industrial equipment using time-series analysis and deep learning. The system collected sensor data from manufacturing equipment, processed it using LSTM networks, and predicted potential failures up to 72 hours in advance with 92% accuracy. Implementation in a semiconductor manufacturing facility reduced unplanned downtime by 35% and maintenance costs by 28%.
